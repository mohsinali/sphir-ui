# Sphir
The purpose of this project is to propose a new infrastructure and tech-stack for Sphir.  

The front-end will be built on ReactJS. For now I am not thinking about any server-side language because I will be using Elasticsearch as single source of truth.

Later on we can introduce more services that may include an API server.
